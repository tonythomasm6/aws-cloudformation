AWS Infrastructure Architecture
============================

1. VPC (1.vpc.yml)
   - VPC with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16
   - 3 Public Subnets (10.0.4.0/24, 10.0.5.0/24, 10.0.6.0/24)
   - 3 Private Subnets (10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24, 10.0.3.0/24)
   - Internet Gateway for public internet access
   - 3 NAT Gateways (one in each public subnet)
   - Route Tables for public and private subnets
   - Exports: VPC, PublicSubnet1-3, PrivateSubnet1-3

2. EC2 Instances (2.Instance.yml)
   - Auto Scaling Group with Launch Template
   - Application Load Balancer (ALB) in public subnets
   - Target Group for health checks
   - Security Groups for ALB and instances
   - IAM Role with SSM and Secrets Manager access
   - HTTPS listener with SSL certificate
   - HTTP to HTTPS redirect
   - Route53 DNS record for ALB
   - Exports: InstanceSecurityGroup

3. Bastion Host (3.bastionhost.yml)
   - EC2 instance in public subnet
   - Security Group with SSH access
   - IAM Role with SSM access
   - Key Pair for SSH access
   - SSM Parameters:
     - JUMPBOX_KEYPAIR: Key pair reference
     - JUMPBOX_IP: Public IP address
   - Exports: BastionHostPublicIP, BastionHostSecurityGroupId

4. RDS Database (4.RDS.yml)
   - MySQL 8.0 RDS instance
   - Multi-AZ deployment
   - Security Group with access from instances and bastion
   - Secrets Manager for credentials
   - Route53 DNS record
   - Exports: MyRDSInstanceEndpoint, MyRDSSecretArn

Security Features:
- HTTPS encryption for web traffic
- Private subnets for application instances
- Bastion host for secure access
- IAM roles with least privilege
- Secrets Manager for sensitive data
- Security Groups with minimal access

Monitoring:
- Health checks for ALB
- CloudWatch metrics for instances
- RDS performance insights

Deployment Order:
1. VPC (1.vpc.yml)
2. RDS (4.RDS.yml)
3. Bastion Host (3.bastionhost.yml)
4. Application (2.Instance.yml)

Flow Description:
----------------
1. Internet → Internet Gateway → Public Subnet
2. Public Subnet → NAT Gateway → Private Subnets
3. Bastion Host → EC2 Instances (for management)
4. EC2 Instances → RDS Instance (application to database)
5. Security Groups control access at each layer

Security Groups:
---------------
- EC2 Security Group: Controls traffic to EC2 instances
- RDS Security Group: Controls traffic to RDS instance
- Bastion Security Group: Controls access to bastion host

High Availability:
-----------------
- Resources distributed across multiple AZs
- NAT Gateway provides redundancy
- RDS configured for high availability

Monitoring:
----------
- CloudWatch for monitoring and logging
- AWS Systems Manager for instance management
- AWS Config for compliance monitoring
